## Install Mangaki

### Database setup

You need to have PostgreSQL >9.3 running on your machine. You also need an
user that will have access to the database. The easiest way to achieve that is
simply to create an account which has the same name as your username, which
can create databases, and which is a superuser (for CREATE EXTENSION):

    sudo -u postgres createuser --superuser --createdb $USER

Then create the database, and add the required extensions:

    createdb mangaki
    psql -d mangaki -c \
        "create extension if not exists pg_trgm; \
         create extension if not exists unaccent"

### Running the web server

First, copy the configuration. The default parameters are already supposed to
work, so you shouldn't need to change anything:

    cp mangaki/settings{.template,}.ini

You can then install the Django environment:

    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements/dev.txt
    ./mangaki/manage.py migrate
    ./mangaki/manage.py runserver

And voil√†! You can access Mangaki at http://localhost:8000.

### Running background tasks (Celery)

Background tasks represent:

- importing anime from another database;
- looking for duplicates in the database;
- (in a near future) improve Mangaki models.

These are optional, but if you want to try them:

     # Ensure that your working directory contains manage.py
     celery -B -A mangaki:celery_app worker -l INFO

If you can read something like this:

```console
[2018-08-23 13:37:42,000: INFO/MainProcess] celery@your_hostname ready.
```

The worker is ready to receive background tasks (e.g. MAL imports).

### VM install

You can also [install Mangaki in a VM](https://github.com/mangaki/mangaki/wiki/How-to-install-Mangaki-using-a-virtual-machine-(simple-but-takes-2-GB)) using our amazing Ansible playbooks.

It's simple but takes 2 GB.

## Populate the database with a few fixtures

The database starts empty, but you can populate a few works:

    ./manage.py loaddata ../fixtures/{partners,seed_data}.json
    ./manage.py ranking    # Compute the anime/manga ranking pages. Should be done regularly.
    ./manage.py top --all  # Compute the Top 20 directors, etc. Should be done regularly.
    ./manage.py test       # Run all tests
