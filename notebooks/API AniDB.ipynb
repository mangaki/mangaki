      "<recommendation type=\"Recommended\" uid=\"98119\">Great anime, can`t agree about the shock factor thing. I watched knowing about episode 3 event yet I still found the series a very intense and entertaining experience.</recommendation>\n",
      "<recommendation type=\"Recommended\" uid=\"544948\">Dark magical girl anime has been done before (see Revolutionary Girl Utena) but never before with this much flare. Fantastic characters and riveting drama and a climax that doesn`t let you down mean it`s one of the most solid series.</recommendation>\n",
      "<recommendation type=\"Recommended\" uid=\"317067\">Definitely not for everyone. Deliciously fucked up and emotionally intense, this is not what the cover image makes it look like. Very unique, very interesting, and a very good anime.</recommendation>\n",
      "<recommendation type=\"Recommended\" uid=\"281995\">If you`re looking for Sailor Moon X here, you`re in the wrong place. This is a totally different take on mahou shoujo shows. Much deeper and serious. The plot is a bit slow and boring at the beginning, but the second half of the show makes up for it big time.</recommendation>\n",
      "<recommendation type=\"Recommended\" uid=\"458655\">Wow, I`m only half way through and I`m enjoying this. I don`t watch MS stuff but this has a more mature, dark feeling to it. So dark, it`s as if this show was meant more for guys than girls!</recommendation>\n",
      "<recommendation type=\"Recommended\" uid=\"177436\">An excellent, and original concept, excellent, creative artwork, excellent music... Let down by poor pacing. This series should have worked really well, and been a breath of fresh air for anime. Unfortunately, the story meanders and and fourth for most of the series, and it`s only in the last few episodes that things start to pick up and the story is at it`s strongest. A real shame, perhaps someone else will try the same concept in the future, and learn from the mistakes Madoka made.</recommendation>\n",
      "<recommendation type=\"Recommended\" uid=\"479550\">Don`t think of this as a just another magical girl show. That`s what lots of people did when it came out and then a few weeks later, all the mahou shoujo fans were like `WTF!? o.0`\n",
      "\n",
      "In the words of journalist Matt Kamen, \"With its...daring approach to a dated genre, Puella Magi Madoka Magica essentially does for magical girls what Neon Genesis Evangelion did for giant robots.\"\n",
      "I sometimes refer to it as a subversion of the mahou shoujo genre. That`s how different this is.\n",
      "\n",
      "great soundtrack, visuals (it`s supposed to look super cutesy, adds to said subversion) especially love the witch world visuals, seiyuu (though madoka`s sounded a little annoying but it was how her character should be anyways)</recommendation>\n",
      "<recommendation type=\"Recommended\" uid=\"341225\">After reading all the \"OMG magic lolis!\" comments I expected something different. Actually I could expect anything but what I`ve seen here is completely different.\n",
      "It`s not usual candy series full of sparkles and that stuff. It`s deep story about humanity including psychedelic magical worlds full of what-not.\n",
      "I`m not able to mark this as must see for some reason, but I can recommend it for sure</recommendation>\n",
      "<recommendation type=\"Recommended\" uid=\"560966\">Deconstruction of the mahou shoujo genre at its best.</recommendation>\n",
      "<recommendation type=\"Recommended\" uid=\"318047\">Tried like hell to ignore this title. Just couldn`t get the notion of mahou shoujo not adding a saccharin taste to my palette of anime. I was WRONG just plain WRONG. Had to skip most of the intros and a few of the end credits though. They just didn`t encourage my desire to watch a series with more depth than the normal merchandising machines.</recommendation>\n",
      "<recommendation type=\"Recommended\" uid=\"444051\">Personally I am absolutely no fan of this genre. I hate almost every aspect of the mahou shoujo genre. Despite my preferences, i watched this and wow. This is one of the darkest anime i`ve seen. I recommend this anime to everyone, even if you don`t like the genre.</recommendation>\n",
      "<recommendation type=\"Recommended\" uid=\"520752\">Pretty deep story. Half of the episodes make you think \"what would I do in that kind of situation\". Not the average Magical Girl story. Once you get the idea behind the story, you will just love it. Last but not least, this anime doesn`t have a half unfinished ending like the most out there. I definitely recommend watching the whole anime in one go, it`s not even 5hours. :D</recommendation>\n",
      "<recommendation type=\"Recommended\" uid=\"125248\">Short  &amp; strong. Ignore \"mahou shoujo\" thing and watch it.</recommendation>\n",
      "<recommendation type=\"Recommended\" uid=\"267233\">The plot is heavy and interesting, the animation can be pretty unique (which may turn some people off but the animation makes sense if you think about it), and the music is great.   If I had to describe this series, I`d say it is like a base of Magical Lyrical combined with Mokona (CLAMP) and with some Higurashi-like elements.  I can`t say much more (or use better descriptions) without spoiling this great anime!  It is one of the few animes (Like Jigoku Shoujo and Higurashi) that I can actually watch multiple times in a row.\n",
      "\n",
      "While I wouldn`t give this a 10 (due to the first two episodes being hard to keep watching for many of my friends) and my personal dislike of episode 3, This does get better, especially after episode 7 (halfway through the series).  This is extremely plot filled compared to many other Mahou Shoujo series and is worth the wait in my opinion.</recommendation>\n",
      "<recommendation type=\"Recommended\" uid=\"265326\">\"Wait what ?! Magical Girl Anime so highly rated ?! and so popular ?!  \" \n",
      "That was my though process when i heard about this anime . I put if off for quite some time . Card Captor Sakura was ENOUGH FOR ME ! . \n",

      "Then one night , i started watching seeing i had it in HDD.............. Ended up finishing in the same night with allot of caffeine to keep me going,\n",
      "It is just simply , staggering i couldn`t believe that this can be pulled off from the \"magical girl\" anime genre . \n",
      "It`s truly breathtaking the profoundness of this anime.\n",

      "<recommendation type=\"Recommended\" uid=\"493983\">No matter what you think about Mahou Shojou anime, you`ll be shocked by this one.</recommendation>\n",
      "<recommendation type=\"Recommended\" uid=\"495882\">I would not call this anime \"twisted\" or \"demented\" as much as I would call it \"shocking.\" It is definitely a different take on the magical girl genre.</recommendation>\n",
      "<recommendation type=\"Recommended\" uid=\"154026\">A very unique approach to the mahou shojo theme with the usual artistic animation from Shaft. I recommend it especially if you are tired of all the un-inovative anime out there.</recommendation>\n",
      "<recommendation type=\"Recommended\" uid=\"473323\">Started off extremely bad, so bad that i dropped it at first. But i forced myself to watch it and things got alot better. From 1 point to 7. Give it a try! Endure the first episodes, it gets much better after a while!</recommendation>\n",
      "<recommendation type=\"Must See\" uid=\"31717\">Definitely not your typical Mahou Shoujo series. This dark themed take on the category is a must see for all, especially for people who are bored by the typical pace of the Mahou Shoujo series.</recommendation>\n",
      "<recommendation type=\"Must See\" uid=\"526839\">Really had to drag myself through the first few episodes, BUT it was well worth the intense action and drama. This whole anime has a dark and mysterious air to it,so don`t be deceived. Great characters, and the plot really soared after the beginning episodes. Full of surprises, dark secrets and nicely crafted action scenes. A must see because it`s something really hard to come by these days.</recommendation>\n",

      "<recommendation type=\"Must See\" uid=\"60478\">Forget about card captor sakura, this has only first episodes that can be similar, but becomes dark at the end.\n",
      "Can`t even say if it has an happy end, watch it and find i t out :)</recommendation>\n",
      "<recommendation type=\"Must See\" uid=\"564967\">Even if you don`t like the magical girl genre - don`t get fooled by the overly cute style it has. The first three episodes make it seem as if it`s like any other girly adorable little magical girl anime - but then it drastically changes. I`ve had at least three friends refusing to watch it because it didn`t seem as their style; I don`t blame them, I was the same. But when they saw the rest of it? They ended up LOVING it, just like I do. It completely gets you off guard. The story is great, the characters are great. I highly recommend it.</recommendation>\n",
      "<recommendation type=\"Must See\" uid=\"335602\">The greatest anime ever made. This is pure mind fuckery in a usually childish genre where cruel things happen, with an incredibly misleading cover. What Evangelion did for the mecha genre is what this anime will do for the magical girl genre, and possibly even beyond that. You`ll watch this entire series in awe, as you haven`t ever seen something as great as this.</recommendation>\n",

      "\n",
      "The story is so deep, sad and so touching that it seems to be almost a parody to the whole theme. It is in fact a far cry from what you first think it is.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, as usual, Kajiura Yuki (the reason I actually saw this show) did an awesome job with the music.\n",
      "\n",
      "I highly recommend!</recommendation>\n",
      "<recommendation type=\"Must See\" uid=\"478043\">If you watch this anime without any prior knowledge of its story like I did, you get pretty blown away as it progresses. A very refreshing take on the traditional \"magical girl\" genre with great character development.</recommendation>\n",
      "<recommendation type=\"Must See\" uid=\"567315\">What can I say? This is truly a masterpiece. As a fan of dark anime, I was pleasantly surprised by this anime`s take on the magical girl theme. It was an absolutely incredible experience and not one that I will forget. One of the best anime I have ever seen. The final episode gets a little existential, but if you can get your brain around what is going on, and you don`t mind a heavy story, then this is THE anime to put at the top of your watchlist.</recommendation>\n",
      "<recommendation type=\"Must See\" uid=\"79717\">Totally worth the time watching. It was very nicley done, but there might be some plot holes at the end.</recommendation>\n",
      "<recommendation type=\"Must See\" uid=\"2975\">Just excellent.</recommendation>\n",
      "<recommendation type=\"Must See\" uid=\"488184\">It`s true you don`t have to be a fan of the Mahou Shoujo theme to like this anime. It`s a dark anime that has decent amount of action, but really good storyline. For an original story it`s one of the best. The only people who wouldn`t like this are hardcore action fans who pay no attention to nice character development, good plot twists, and emotional drama (not as much as devoted drama genre, though). Anyone who loves \"WTF is going on?!\" series that creatively fills in the blanks would instantly put this on their top 10.</recommendation>\n",
      "<recommendation type=\"Must See\" uid=\"480218\">A surprisingly dark show that you just don`t really see in the magical girl genre.  It looks pretty typical (if somewhat bizarre thanks to SHAFT) at first, but give it a couple of episodes and you will see it is not your typical magical girl show at all.\n",
      "I strongly recommend checking it out, even if you aren`t really into the magical girl genre.  As of time of writing, it`s one of the best new shows I`ve seen in a while.</recommendation>\n",
      "<recommendation type=\"Must See\" uid=\"352369\">I watched this expecting the same old Magical girl cliche, but this show blindsided me by being a totally new take on an old cliche genre. A must see just for the fact that it`s a perfect example of never judging a book by it`s cover.</recommendation>\n",
      "<recommendation type=\"Must See\" uid=\"350228\">This is one of the series which should be recommended for educational purposes, it is simply a cultural phenomen.</recommendation>\n",
      "<recommendation type=\"Must See\" uid=\"1323\">Takes the mahou shoujo genre and completely turns it on its head. A series with a real story - and a roller-coaster ride at that.</recommendation>\n",
      "<recommendation type=\"Must See\" uid=\"3688\">Extremely Dark, Darkness beyond boundaries, endless despair - and Super Nova of Light in the end! This is very charming composition - real Yin&amp;Yang in perfect balance.</recommendation>\n",
      "<recommendation type=\"Must See\" uid=\"218852\">Really interesting deconstruction of the mahou shoujo concept, not only for fans of the genre, but for anyone interested in a anime far deeper than the standard ecchi show we usually are served nowadays.</recommendation>\n",
      "<recommendation type=\"Must See\" uid=\"240459\">The most beautiful plot I`ve seen in years.</recommendation>\n",
      "<recommendation type=\"Must See\" uid=\"366429\">Not your typical mahou shoujo.\n",
      "This anime twists the genre `conventions` and creates a creepy, menacing atmosphere.</recommendation>\n",
      "<recommendation type=\"Must See\" uid=\"444838\">Sakura Card Captor is dethroned, Lyrical Nanoha lies on the floor and Sailor Moon runs for the hills. Long reign to the new queen of Mahou-Shoujo!!!!\n",
      "Long have I wanted a darker view on this genre, something that really exploits the really dark themes that surround the genre. Don`t be fooled by the cuteness, this is really tough and psychological.\n",
      "The best anime from 2010. Period.</recommendation>\n",
      "<recommendation type=\"Must See\" uid=\"311537\">very emotional anime and best mahou shoujo till now, you can enjoy it even if you`re not fan of this genre.</recommendation>\n",
      "<recommendation type=\"Must See\" uid=\"244372\">Mahou shoujo anime which really wasn`t one :P\n",
      "Nice and interesting anime, except they really complicated things at end for no reason... made me use 2 much brain power to figure out what did writer exactly want to say.\n",
      "Reminds me a bit of noein for some reason.</recommendation>\n",
      "<recommendation type=\"Must See\" uid=\"445322\">If you`re not hooked by ep 3 then... No, you will be hooked. A good one for anyone who knows what a trope is. Keep away from young children.</recommendation>\n",
      "<recommendation type=\"Must See\" uid=\"183526\">Even if you are not a fan of mahou shoujo genre, this show is something you ought to see as it is an anime that has surely left a significant mark in the history of anime.</recommendation>\n",
      "<recommendation type=\"Must See\" uid=\"367836\">An anime with the most consistent high quality, will keep you in place from (almost very) beginning till end. And yet the piece hasnt become what it could be</recommendation>\n",
      "<recommendation type=\"Must See\" uid=\"211221\">Just a real pleasure to watch.  If you want to get technical, you can definitely pick a bone or 2 with the story and ending.  However, it never got in the way of wanting more.</recommendation>\n",
      "<recommendation type=\"Must See\" uid=\"447133\">The top anime of the winter season 2011 and possibly the best of the whole year. This isn`t supposed to be a funny story ( as some might think ) or moeblobshit. This anime is beautiful, intense and cruel and can rival the likes of Bakemono and NGE.</recommendation>\n",
      "<recommendation type=\"Must See\" uid=\"221060\">dark and moody, there is always that hanging feeling that you know something bad is going to happen at one point. and then one by one, things fall into place and then until at the very end, everything comes full circle and you just realize that that was one heck of a ride.</recommendation>\n",
      "<recommendation type=\"Must See\" uid=\"249386\">As of now,  only 6 eps are broadcasts, but simply this is the best mahou shoujo anime ever. I hope it can last until the very end.</recommendation>\n",
      "<recommendation type=\"Must See\" uid=\"211996\">I just watched all the episodes in one sitting...not much to say here other than WHOA!

      "<name>contemporary fantasy</name>\n",
      "<description>Contemporary fantasy, also known as modern fantasy or indigenous fantasy, is a sub-genre of fantasy, set in the present day. It is perhaps most popular for its sub-genre, urban fantasy.\n",
      "These terms are used to describe stories set in the putative real world (often referred to as consensus reality) in contemporary times, in which magic and magical creatures exist, either living in the interstices of our world or leaking over from alternate worlds. It thus has much in common with, and sometimes overlaps with secret history; a work of fantasy in which the magic could not remain secret or does not have any known relationship to known history would not fit into this subgenre. Occasionally certain contemporary fantasy novels will make reference to pop culture.\n",
      "Novels in which modern characters travel into alternate worlds, and all the magical action takes place there (except for the portal required to transport them), are not considered contemporary fantasy. Thus, C.S. Lewis`s The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, where all fantasy events take place in the land of Narnia which is reached via a magic wardrobe, would not count as contemporary fantasy; on the other hand, the part of The Magician`s Nephew, where the Empress Jadis gets to London, tries to take over the Earth and clashes with police and a crowd of cockneys, would qualify as such.\n",
      "Contemporary fantasy is also to be distinguished from horror fiction, which also often has contemporary settings. When encountering magical events and creatures, the protagonist of a horror novel is horrified, while the protagonist of a fantasy novel (contemporary or otherwise) is filled with a sense of joy and wonder. Horrifying events may happen, but the fundamental distinction is vital.\n",
      "In his preface to That Hideous Strength, one of the earlier works falling within this sub-genre, C.S. Lewis explained why, when writing a tale about \"magicians, devils, pantomime animals and planetary angels\", he chose to start it with a detailed depiction of narrow-minded academic politics at a provincial English university and the schemes of crooked real estate developers: \"I am following the traditional fairy-tale. We do not always notice its method, because the cottages, castles, woodcutters and petty kings with which a fairy tale opens have become for us as remote as the witches and ogres to which it proceeds. But they were not remote at all to the men who first made and enjoyed the tales\". The same is true for many of the later works in the genre, which often begin with a seemingly normal scene of modern daily life to then disclose supernatural and magical beings and events hidden behind the scenes.\n",

      "<description>Nudity is the state of wearing no clothing. The wearing of clothing is exclusively a human characteristic. The amount of clothing worn depends on functional considerations (such as a need for warmth or protection from the elements) and social considerations. In some situations the minimum amount of clothing (i.e. covering of a person`s genitals) may be socially acceptable, while in others much more clothing is expected.\n",
      "People, as individuals and in groups, have varying attitudes towards their own nudity. Some people are relaxed about appearing less than fully clothed in front of others, while others are uncomfortable or inhibited in that regard. People are nude in a variety of situations, and whether they are prepared to disrobe in front of others depends on the social context in which the issue arises. For example, people need to bathe without clothing, some people also sleep in the nude, some prefer to sunbathe in the nude or at least topless, while others are nude in other situations. Some people adopt naturism as a lifestyle.\n",
      "Though the wearing of clothes is the social norm in most cultures, some cultures, groups and individuals are more relaxed about nudity, though attitudes often depend on context. On the other hand, some people feel uncomfortable in the presence of any nudity, and the presence of a nude person in a public place can give rise to controversy, irrespective of the attitude of the person who is nude. Besides meeting social disapproval, in some places public nudity may constitute a crime of indecent exposure. Many people have strong views on nudity, which to them can involve issues and standards of modesty, decency and morality. Some people have an psychological aversion to nudity, called gymnophobia. Many people regard nudity to be inherently sexual and erotic.\n",
      "Nudity is to be found in a multitude of media, including art, photography, film and on the Internet. It is a factor in adult entertainment of various types.\n",
      "Especially gratuitous fanservice anime shows tend to show their (usually female) characters frequently without any clothes, though often hiding genitals through the means of additions like steam.\n",

      "<description>Fantasy is a genre of fiction that uses magic and other supernatural phenomena as a primary element of plot, theme, or setting. Many works within the genre take place in fictional worlds where magic is common. Fantasy is generally distinguished from science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of (pseudo-)scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three (which are subgenres of speculative fiction).\n",
      "In popular culture, the genre of fantasy is dominated by its medievalist form, especially since the worldwide success of The Lord of the Rings books by J. R. R. Tolkien. In its broadest sense however, fantasy comprises works by many writers, artists, filmmakers, and musicians, from ancient myths and legends to many recent works embraced by a wide audience today.\n",
      "Fantasy is a vibrant area of academic study in a number of disciplines (English, cultural studies, comparative literature, history, medieval studies). Work in this area ranges widely, from the structuralist theory of Tzvetan Todorov, which emphasizes the fantastic as a liminal space, to work on the connections (political, historical, literary) between medievalism and popular culture\n",

      "<name>off-model animation</name>\n",
      "<description>Anime shows tend to most often run on an already tight budget; some have even tighter ones. Thus, over the years it became a norm to invest more time and money into the first and last episode, leaving many episodes in the middle to stand severe budget restrictions. This sometimes results in episodes which particularly stand out due to the drop in artwork or animation quality; bar some basic framework, they often have little in common with the rest of the series.\n",
      "One clue to upcoming off-model animation is the noticeable addition of many Korean names in the production credits, as farming out more animation to Korean artists is a nearly universal indicator of a production company trying to save money in all possible ways.\n",
      "This effect is often called yashigani, after the infamous http://anidb.net/e4682 [fourth episode] of http://anidb.net/a403 [Lost Universe], Yashigani Hoburu. Another prominent term describing the same effect is \"QUALITY animation\", with capital letters meant to show contrast to actual quality. http://anidb.net/a4531 [Yoake Mae yori Ruriiro na: Crescent Love] is another legendarily terrible offender: the TV airing of its http://anidb.net/e63752 [third episode] had a perfectly spherical ball in place of what should be a cabbage; the \"cabbage\" was so egregious that it became closely associated with the anime itself, to a point the show would henceforth be nicknamed \"Cabbage Love\" among Western viewers.\n",
      "One should not confuse the yashigani effect with art shifts that stem from guest staff, changes in main staff, intentional art shifts, and similar effects. Another effect one shouldn`t confuse this one with is the so-called DVD/BD enhancement, which is when a studio scrambles to meet the deadline for a TV airing and airs a half-finished episode but eventually fixes it for a disk release; for example, http://anidb.net/cr792 [Shaft] is particularly infamous for its disk enhancements, to a point it has become known as \"Shafting\", and they prominently feature intentionally weird character models, but they don`t often leave bad artwork on the disk release. Additionally, it should also not be confused with intentional lack of detail on background plane characters; this effect is instead when even the foreground has art quality shifting over time due to the aforementioned budget restrictions.</description>\n",

The original was followed by \"Almond Pocky\" in 1971, with an almond coating, and \"Strawberry Pocky\" in 1977. Today, the product line includes such variations as milk, mousse, green tea, honey, banana and coconut flavored coatings, and themed products such as \"Decorer Pocky,\" with colourful decorative stripes in the coating, and \"Men`s Pocky,\" a dark (bittersweet) chocolate and \"mature\" version.\n",

Madoka becomes uncertain about becoming a Puella Magi after Mami`s death in battle, though she still accompanies her friend, Sayaka, on witch hunts. She is averse to fighting and wishes that everyone would get along. She is implied to have large amount of magical potential within her, and Kyubey is particularly interested in forming a contract with her; however, she has yet to take him up on the offer.</description>\n",

He has so far made contracts with Mami, Kyouko and Sayaka, and shows particular interest in making Madoka a magical girl. It is yet to be revealed if there are other familiars besides him. As a magical creature, he can only be seen or heard by Puella Magis and those with magical potential. He is shown to consume used Grief Seeds, though for what reason is unknown. His true motives are unknown, and he constantly tries to find chances to persuade girls with magical potential to form a contract with him despite knowing the dangers that a Puella Magi faces. He tends to have little understanding of human values and doesn`t believe what he`s doing is cruel. If he is killed, another Kyuubee takes his place and consumes the previous one. Homura recognizes his true identity as Incubator.</description>\n",

Amusingly, she is always seen eating something, even while she is battling Sayaka. When Kyouko learns Sayaka had become a Puella Magi just before she arrived, she becomes Sayaka`s enemy for allegedly stealing her territory, although she later tries to help her after learning the truth about Soul Gems. She comes from a poor church family and used her wish so that people would listen to her father`s preachings. However, when her father learned of this, he went mad and killed his entire family. As such, Kyouko decided only to use her magic for herself, since using it for others will only cause despair. Having grown up in a poor family, she often has to steal food and hates wasting it, a logic she also applies to Grief Seeds, as she only goes after fully grown witches. Kyouko wields a spear which can extend itself, split into multiple sections, and produce a ball at the end of the chain, which can constrict and hit others at the same time.</description>\n",

Later on, the entrance area becomes a long corridor filled with concert posters. The center of the Labyrinth appears to be a distorted concert hall, where the seats fill the domed ceiling. Her weapons appear to be manifested wheels, and the concert hall is populated with a spectral string orchestra.\n",
