How to install the development environment

- Make sure you have at least Python v3 installed (you may want to call python3
  instead of python)
- Make sure you have installed Django ('import django' in python3 should not
  print any errors)
- Finally, make sure you have a running postgresql server (a few pointers:
  http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/static/postgres-user.html)

Alright, now let's take care of the required Django modules. Run pip install
-r requirements.txt. Be sure to run it with root privileges, as some package's
installation will require it.Grab a cup of coffee, it can take some time.

Now just run mangaki/manage.py runserver
