Euphonium was the obligatory KyoAni show I picked up during Spring 2015. I had finished exam season so I needed to watch something relaxing. I was reluctant at first since I'm not really a fan of bands (I'm more of an orchestra person) but I was pleasantly surprised. Hibike! Euphonium combines stunning animation with my favorite genre.\n\n~~~__Story__~~~\n~~~img520(https:\/\/mahoutofu.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/04\/hibike_2-4.png)~~~\n\nThe story starts off with the main character transferring to a new school. She used to play euphonium and is hesitant to join the school band. Once she does, the focus of the story switches to the band aiming for the national competition. Along the way, we get to know more characters and their reasons for doing band. All in all it's a fairly simple story but one that is well done. Getting to know all the characters still made for a very enjoyable plot.\n~~~\n__Characters__~~~\n\n~~~img520(https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/-RfVEC_qajFo\/VZaqHGWpr8I\/AAAAAAAArkk\/LuXprp8mqeM\/s640\/Hibike%252521%252520Euphonium%252520-%25252005%252520-%252520Large%25252033.jpg)~~~\n\nKyoAni shines in the character design department once again. Our main heroine, Kumiko Oumae, isn't your typically dainty airhead female lead . She's cool and sometimes even sarcastic. Her friends are the type of girls you would think to be the main characters. The other members of the band are just as interesting and fun to meet. Each of their designs is truly unique. Asuka is a flamboyant vice president, Taki is an understanding conductor, Reina has the most incredible smile, ever. These are only some of the characters that you will get to meet. The interaction between these characters during sectional practice is great and it's inspiring to see how the camaraderie among these young musicians grows. All in all, the characters were probably one of the standout parts of Hibike!\n\n~~~__Animation and Sound__~~~\n~~~img520(https:\/\/secure.static.tumblr.com\/5875e589c38e7d09142b67ccdd71be34\/ierdv6m\/Tgnnmvqu2\/tumblr_static_tumblr_static_au3r840l6rk0w8w4ws0kk0sgo_640.gif)\n~~~\nDo I really need to say much about the animation of this show? As usual, backgrounds are colorful and stunning! I'd say the main highlight would be the animation of the actual band. In Shigatsu wa Kimi Uso, we didn't get to see much animation of the music scenes and the animation in Nodame Cantabile was quite choppy. Hibike! gets it right with its smooth transitions and sequences.\n\n~~~img520(http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/34TLVTC.jpg)~~~\n~~~_Dat bokeh tho_~~~\n\nI was never really a fan of what high school bands played because from my experience, my high school band plays obscure songs from musicals and \"jazz\". However, this is a show focused around a high school band in Japan. The music selection is nothing short of incredible! I enjoyed getting to listen to new kinds of music. One of my favorites was the piece played during the marching competition. Of course, if you aren't into the symphony, then this might not be to your liking.\n\nThe soundtrack for the solid. Many tracks have a happy vibe that is reminiscent of being young and some tracks have that good emotional feel. You just need to listen to it. On the official soundtrack, there are even different tracks for the trumpet solo audition. Overall very impressed.\n\n~~~__Personal Enjoyment__~~~\n~~~img520(http:\/\/i61.tinypic.com\/rtq1c0.jpg)~~~\n\n\nThis show really hit it home with me. I used to be a member of my school's orchestra so I can understand where many of the characters are coming from when it comes to being new, stressing out over competitions, conducting sectional practice, and experiencing that drama (having to deal with slackers, fear of failure, that special someone in the other section) that comes with being a part of the performing arts division of your school. Hibike! Euphonium reminded me of some of my fondest memories of high school. It's a real treat for anyone who has had a similar experience to me.\n\n~~~img520(https:\/\/49.media.tumblr.com\/145d93bc86d32d291d712b885406e3fe\/tumblr_nqrs9pKysi1s307p6o1_500.gif)~~~\n\nEven if you know nothing about music, this show is still spectacular. If you don't enjoy the music aspect, then the slice of life will most likely impress you. However, if you don't enjoy music, slice of life, or cute girls playing woodwind and brass instruments, then this probably isn't your show.\n\n~~~__Conclusion__~~~\n\n~~~img420(http:\/\/static.zerochan.net\/Hibike!.Euphonium.full.1873272.jpg)\n~~~\nKyoto Animation is my favorite studio and Hibike! Euphonium is why. The splendid animation, interesting characters, and varied soundtrack all combine for a decent show. I didn't really have any gripes with it. If you love slice of life, you need to watch this, If you love the music genre, you need to watch this. And if you love KyoAni like I do, you need to watch this. Trust me, this show really does end on a high note.",

            "text": "_Sound! Euphonium_ is another series that caught me suprised. In essence, it's a show similar to _Free!_ and _K-On!_ in that it's a story about a high school club, produced by the famous KyoAni studio. However, compared to those two shows (which I didn't particularly enjoy), it takes some new and interesting directions which freshen up the stale formula, resulting in quite a unique series.\n\n~~~img480(http:\/\/vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net\/hibike-euphonium\/images\/7\/7e\/Ep6.jpg)~~~\n\nThe most important part of _Sound!_ are the characters. The series follows Kumiko Oumae, a high school freshman, who decided that she \"wanted a new start\" and therefore go somewhere where not many of her previous schoolmates went. Her two new friends and classmates are Midori and Katou, who are both very upbeat and friendly girls, but also the most generic moe characters in the show. However, Katou serves a certain purpose in the story and Midori is very over-the-top with her silliness and cuteness, which not only makes her a more enjoyable character, but also contrasts with how hardcore she is about playing contrabass (this is a recurring theme). Shuuichi is Kumiko\u2019s childhood friend and a potential love interest. He's one of the few male characters and he's very bland, but his role is very minor, so it's not a big problem. The band advisor, mister Taki, is clearly passionate about the music, and is the type of person who will criticise you with a smile on his face. He has some unusual teaching methods and as a new member of the school staff he has an interesting relationship with the concert band. Furthermore, the section leaders are mostly nice and friendly, Kumiko's teacher is a strict but kind-hearted lady and various band members are mostly background characters. However, some of them get a small amount of screen time without main characters and small bits of personality, which is a nice touch that helps flesh out the world and slow down the tempo, giving the viewer breathing room without boring him.\n\nThe three most interesting characters are bass section leader Asuka, Kumiko herself and her friend Reina. Asuka is also the vice-president of the concert band club, and initially seems like a very outgoing person. She's the one talking the most to freshmen, convincing them to join the band, and later her section. She seems friendly with everyone, but also very full of herself. However, as we learn later, she\u2019s not very reliable. Everyone wanted her to be the the president, but she didn\u2019t want to and only agreed to be the vice-president as compromise. And she doesn\u2019t take sides on any issue, avoids answering questions she doesn\u2019t want to and generally refuses to take responsibility. In fact the times she seems the most honest is when she says \u201cI don\u2019t care\u201d, whatever the topic is. However, she\u2019s smart, good looking and a very good euphonium player, which makes her popular despite those vices. In fact the only time we see her upset is when she\u2019s losing practice time due to teenage drama in the section (note - a major change of the character when with the instrument in her hands). I think she\u2019s quite an interesting character because the longer the series goes, the more mysterious she gets - it\u2019s very unclear what is the natural behaviour for her, and what is just a facade she keeps for whatever reason.\n\n~~~img480(http:\/\/vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net\/hibike-euphonium\/images\/9\/99\/Ep3.jpg)~~~\n\nReina is a talented and hard-working trumpet player, who previously played with Kumiko in a junior high band. On the surface, she\u2019s polite, well-mannered and dutiful, but also distant and hard to read. However, she\u2019s a major example of a character that is much different with the instrument in her hands. Especially because she\u2019s very confident in her abilities, and doesn\u2019t shy away from claiming she\u2019s better than her seniors  However, more than for any other band member, the trumpet is a mean to express herself. When band practice stops due to attitude issues, she vents by playing a fragment of Dvorak\u2019s 9th symphony on the school grounds. When the band is nervous before a performance, she changes the atmosphere by playing a loud note on the trumpet, despite the fact they were asked not to play while waiting for their turn. She\u2019s also notorious for practicing more than her fellow band members.\n\nThis contrast is later explained as she opens up to Kumiko and reveals her true nature - she wants to be special. She\u2019s not interested in popularity or meeting expectations, but rather in standing out and living up to her own standard. This means not being afraid to compete against her seniors, not backing out due to peer pressure and practicing more than anyone. We also learn that she does in fact have feelings and empathy, it\u2019s just that she holds them back from most people. And of course Kumiko becomes an exception, as it turns out she\u2019s an opposite of Reina in certain aspects and they grow closer to each other.\n\nWhat I mean by that is that Reina appears distant on the outside, but is quite passionate and caring on the inside. Meanwhile Kumiko is a nice, friendly and polite girl on the outside, but inside she doesn\u2019t seem to care about all that much. I think it\u2019s very interesting in how that comes out in the series. In public, with her teachers, with her bandmates and even with her new friends, she\u2019s a very bright and modest person. Only with Schuuichi, with her sister, to some extent with Asuka and while alone is when she allows herself to either become absent or hostile towards people. Another example of her naturally distant nature is the fact she tends to space out, and it happens the more often the more she is invested in something. This is evident especially towards the end of the series as she focuses on practicing the concert piece and even her new friends start noticing that she\u2019s becoming distant. But whenever something is bothering her, she pays very little attention to the conversations and her surroundings in general. She also has a habit of speaking her thoughts out loud, as if she forgot that there are people around her. Furthermore, her fellow section members point out that it seems like Asuka is acting a little different towards Kumiko, as if she had more respect for her than for other performers. Which is quite interesting considering that Asuka herself seems like a very distant person, and very strict in how close she lets people near herself.\n\nBut then again you can\u2019t ignore how stressed she gets in more than few situations. At the beginning of the series she is very uncomfortable around Reina, as Kumiko is afraid that she is mad at her for a comment she made back in junior high. However, she is able to comfortably talk about the situation with others - going as far as pointing out that she doesn\u2019t think her comment was out of line, even though it upset Reina. Later she becomes very anxious about having to compete for a spot in the main band with an older, but less experienced euphonium player (as traditionally the players were chosen by seniority), which almost makes her withdraw from the auditions. She also has hard time dealing with her childhood friend quitting the band when the practice time gets too long and starts interfering with her studies. However, in my opinion those emotions don\u2019t necessarily contradict with her distant nature, as in all those cases it\u2019s the fear of being pulled out of her comfort zone and drawn into a conflict that make her uneasy. If her nature is to be distant then it\u2019s only natural that she panics when there\u2019s a risk of being forced to deal with people.\n\n~~~img480(http:\/\/vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net\/hibike-euphonium\/images\/5\/5a\/Ep9.jpg)~~~\n\nKumiko also has a very different relationship with her instrument compared to other characters. For starters, at the beginning of the show she doesn\u2019t even want to play euphonium and would rather try something new. The only reason she played it for so long is because it\u2019s an unpopular instrument and her previous bands needed someone to play it, which happens again in high school as well. But as Kumiko matures, so does her relation with the instrument. First she starts to notice the urge to improve, as she pours more and more of herself into practice, even admitting that just like Reina, she also wants to be special. However, it\u2019s only a setback that makes her realise how much she likes the instrument and how important it is to her to become good at playing it (and also how important is it in life to have something you enjoy doing). Once that happens, it seems like she is much more comfortable with showing her true character, which admittedly doesn\u2019t result in a huge change on the outside, but subtly shows the culmination of her growth and maturing throughout the series.\n\nSomething else interesting about KyoAni productions is that they take a very holistic approach to the topics of their shows. In this case, that means showing all parts of life in a concert band - instrument maintenance, transport to the location of performance, tuning instruments, individual practice, group practice, lots of different exercises that musicians do\u2026 Overall - trying to show being a part of concert band for what it really is, instead of ignoring the \u201cugly\u201d parts to make it cooler. And that approach works really well for this show, as it helps set up the nice, slow tempo and generally helps with the immersion. Simultaneously they don\u2019t put too much attention into other parts of characters\u2019 lives, such as their pastimes or studying, only briefly mentioning them when they are somewhat related to the band. On that note, I must also mention that I really liked that romance was a very small part of the series, and whatever we got was very vague - perhaps that\u2019s my personal preference, but I like that the show took a fairly unique approach on that front.\n\n~~~img480(http:\/\/vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net\/hibike-euphonium\/images\/0\/04\/Ep13.jpg)~~~\n\nOverall I think the tempo of the show was fantastic. It tackled issues one at a time, only giving hints of what might be a next problem before the previous is resolved. It distributed information very slowly, not afraid of keeping secrets from the viewer when his focus should be on a different thread. The production (backgrounds, animation, voice acting) was flawless and while I\u2019m not a classical music aficionado, I liked the choice of compositions performed in the show.\n\nIn my opinion _Sound!_ is a coming of age story, more than any other KyoAni show I\u2019ve watched. It deals with themes such as finding your identity, deciding what you want to do in life, maturing, and changing. It shows people\u2019s paths joining, separating and crossing. Its messages are few, simple and told gracefully. Most of all, the series focuses on creating interesting characters and meaningful interactions, and I believe it succeeds at that. I\u2019m not the best person to judge how it fairs in the endless stream of high school slice of life\/drama series. But as far as the coming of age stories go, this one is fresh and unique enough to be worth recommending.",
