    <synopsis>One year has passed since the Black Rebellion, a failed uprising against the Holy Britannian Empire led by the masked vigilante Zero, who is now missing. At a loss without their revolutionary leader, Area 11&amp;#039;s resistance group&amp;mdash;the Black Knights&amp;mdash;find themselves too powerless to combat the brutality inflicted upon the Elevens by Britannia, which has increased significantly in order to crush any hope of a future revolt. &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;

Lelouch Lamperouge, having lost all memory of his double life, is living peacefully alongside his friends as a high school student at Ashford Academy. His former partner C.C., unable to accept this turn of events, takes it upon herself to remind him of his past purpose, hoping that the mastermind Zero will rise once again to finish what he started, in this thrilling conclusion to the series.&lt;br /&gt;

    <synopsis>It is the year 2017, and Europe is being invaded by the forces of the Holy Britannian Empire. In an attempt to combat the opposition&amp;#039;s overwhelming pressure and put an end to the massive casualties, the army forms a special unit called Wyvern, or W-0, composed of former Japanese citizens referred to as &amp;quot;Elevens.&amp;quot; Recruited from ghettos, these young men and women pilot Knightmare frames&amp;mdash;humanoid war machines&amp;mdash;into dangerous operations where death awaits, hoping to make a name for themselves.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;

When a European regiment attempting to recapture a crucial city is pinned down by the enemy, it&amp;#039;s up to W-0 to bail them out. Among those selected for the rescue operation is Lieutenant Akito Hyuuga, known as &amp;quot;Hannibal&amp;#039;s Ghost&amp;quot; due to his prowess on the battlefield. However, the supposed rescue mission becomes suicidal when, in an attempt to take out as many Britannians as possible, the commanding officer initiates the Knightmare&amp;#039;s self-destruct sequence. In its aftermath, Akito finds that he is the last one standing&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;

    <synopsis>With her previous triumphs under her belt, Leila Malcal has now been promoted to Lieutenant Colonel and commanding officer of W-0. After having foiled an attempt to kidnap the General of the European army, she recruits the three perpetrators in order to make up for the lack of W-0&amp;#039;s pilots. Ayano Kosaka, Yukiya Naruse, and ringleader Ryou Sayama accept, in hopes of finding a place to belong. When they are ordered to perform a commando raid by dropping into enemy lines, Leila decides to join them to prevent unnecessary casualties.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;

As the unit rushes into the fight, Akito finds himself possessed by an uncontrollable lust for violence, slaughtering anyone that gets in his way. Little does he know, he is soon to come face to face with the one responsible for placing the bloodthirsty curse upon him, someone he is far too familiar with...&lt;br /&gt;
